// Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations

// Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.


let addNum1 = 10;
let addNum2 = 5;
let sum = addNum1 + addNum2;
console.log('Sum:', sum);


// #### Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.

let subNum1 = 10;
let subNum2 = 5;
let difference = subNum1 - subNum2;
console.log('Difference:', difference);


// #### Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.

let mulNum1 = 10;
let mulNum2 = 5;
let product = mulNum1 * mulNum2;
console.log('Product:', product);


// #### Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.

let divNum1 = 10;
let divNum2 = 5;
let quotient = divNum1 / divNum2;
console.log('Quotient:', quotient);


// #### Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.


let remNum1 = 10;
let remNum2 = 5;
let remainder = remNum1 % remNum2;
console.log('Remainder:', remainder);


// ### Activity 2: Assignment Operators

// #### Task 6: Use the operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.

let a = 10;
a += 5; 
console.log('Result after addition:', a);


// #### Task 7: Use the operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.

let b = 10;
b -= 5; 
console.log('Result after subtraction:', b);


// ### Activity 3: Comparison Operators

// #### Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using `>` and log the result to the console.

let x = 10;
let y = 5;
console.log('x > y:', x > y);


// #### Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using `<` and log the result to the console.

let c = 10;
let d = 5;
console.log('c < b:', a < b);


// ### Activity 4: Logical Operators

// #### Task 10: Write a program to compare two numbers using `>=` and `<=` and log the result to the console.

let e = 10;
let f = 5;
console.log('e >= f:', e >= f);
console.log('e <= f:', e <= f);


// #### Task 11: Write a program that uses the `&&` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.

let g = 10;
let h = 5;
let i = 15;
console.log('x > y && z > x:', g > h && i > g);


// #### Task 12: Write a program that uses the `||` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.


let j = 10;
let k = 5;
let l = 15;
console.log('x > y || z < y:', j > k || l < k);


// #### Task 13: Write a program that uses the `!` operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.


let isRaining = false;
console.log('!isRaining:', !isRaining);


// ### Activity 5: Ternary Operator

// #### Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.


let num = -10;
let result = num >= 0 ? 'Positive' : 'Negative';
console.log('The number is:', result);
